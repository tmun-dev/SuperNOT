SuperHot-Inspired Top-Down Shooter
Developed during my third year of university, this game was a mini-project inspired by SuperHot, but reimagined from a top-down perspective.

I chose SuperHot as my inspiration because of its elegantly simple yet deeply engaging time-slowing mechanic, which creates dynamic and strategic gameplay. My goal was to adapt this concept to a new perspective while maintaining the core tension and fluidity that make SuperHot so compelling.

The game features AI-driven pathfinding and custom logic to introduce alternative NPC behaviors, including turret enemies, adding depth and challenge to the experience.

Let me know if you'd like any refinements! ðŸš€
